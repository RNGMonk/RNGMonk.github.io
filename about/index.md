# About

Hi there, I'm Mike.

I live in London where I work as an independent software consultant. 

 By day I work with various web technologies including React.js, Node.js, Ruby on Rails and Clojure; by night I explore my interest in low level programming with games, compilers and operating systems.

 I'm particularly interested in performance, minimalism and challenging established ideas from first principles to see what sticks.

You can reach me by email at [hi@mikejackson.dev](mailto:hi@mikejackson.dev).
