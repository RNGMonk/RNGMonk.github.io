# Something's wrong with web development.

If you've been in industry for a while, maybe you've had the same feeling I've had. Something's not quite right.

By not quite right, I mean specifically that I'm not convinced that modern web development practices are good, necessarily or beneficial overall. It **FEELS** a lot harder to get things done these days, and yet my sense is that the things we're creating aren't especially more sophisticated on average than 10 years ago. I can't help but wonder if anyone is doing any cost-benefit analysis of various modern approaches to web development.

## Modern Web Development

What a loaded term. You might fairly ask, "what the hell is modern web development anyway?". It's hard to pin down but it includes things like React, Webpack, Babel, Serverless functions, Microservices and their ilk. Perhaps a better way is to say it's not not modern web development.

Traditional web development is easier to categorise. It's Ruby on Rails, it's Djando, it's Laravel, it's typically a web server that renders html and a sprinkle of Javascript for interactivity and uses a relation database for persistence.

## The Rise of Javascript

Even before React and it's counterparts came to dominate web development there was already a steady trend of increasing amount of Javascript on the frontend to create increasingly more interactive web apps. We moved from jQuery and it's plugins, to Backbone (and it's counterparts) and evetually to React + Redux (and it's counterparts).

At around the same time Node appeared on the scene and people who considered themselves frontend developers found a easy route into backend, and backend developers tired of having to use different langauges for the frontend and backend started to embrace Node (despite how different Node and the Browser are).
