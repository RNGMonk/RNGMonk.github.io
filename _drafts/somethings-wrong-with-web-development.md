# Something's wrong with web development.

If you've been in industry for a while, maybe you've had the same feeling I've had. Something's not quite right.

By not quite right, I mean specifically that I'm not convinced that modern web development practices are good, necessarily or beneficial overall. It FEELS a lot harder to get things done these days, and yet my sense is that the things we're creating aren't especially more sophisticated on average than 10 years ago. I can't help but wonder if anyone is doing any cost-benefit analysis of various modern approaches to web development.

## Modern Web Development

What a loaded term. You might fairly ask, "what the hell is modern web development anyway?". It's hard to pin down but it includes things like React, Webpack, Babel, Serverless functions, Microservices and their ilk. Perhaps a better way is to say it's not not modern web development.

Traditional web development is easier to categorise. It's Ruby on Rails, it's Djando, it's Laravel, it's typically a web server that renders html and a sprinkle of Javascript for interactivity and uses a relation database for persistence.
