I've often felt lost in life, disastisfied with the status quo and wondering where to focus my efforts.

As I've gotten older and experienced more, it seems that when reflecting on what to do there are only two broad strategies:

1. Make things more awesome
2. Make things less crappy

## Make Things More Awesome

Making things more awesome could be expressed in many ways. It could be making something entirely new, something that you feel the world needs. It could be niche, it could have more generalised appeal. It could be software, writing, art. Making awesome things is a good strategy when you can't find the thing you are looking for, or the things that exist fail to meet a critical requirement.

There is a danger in that it's tempting to bite off more than you can chew and then get demoralised. "God, Windows 10 is so crappy. I miss the days of Windows XP. I know, I'll make a new awesome operating system and everyone can use that". Operating systems are pretty complicated, so picking up a ambitious undertaking is likely to lead to failure.

A good example of biting off the right amount is Elementary OS. Elementary OS started off as a bunch of people trying to make beautiful icons for linux because they wanted to use an open source operating system without having to compromise on asthetics. Over time they did more and more ambitious work, ultimately leading to their own linux distribution and tightly integrated app ecosystem.
