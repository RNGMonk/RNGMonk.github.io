title: "N Is Usually Small"
category: blog

Recently I've been brushing up on datastructures and algorithms in preparation for some potentially more Google style interviews. Even though I've gone through this a couple times and know what to reach for, I generally always need a couple months to refresh to the point where I feel confident I could implement a variety of datastructures from scratch or reach for and implement the right algorithm for a potential interview question.

What I find interesting is that when you look at people doing high performance computing, algorithmic complexity and advanced datastructures rarely seem to come up. It tends to focus more on minimizing memory latency and effective parallelism and ultimately reminds me of Rob Pikes "Rules for Programming".

In practice N is usually small and so complicated algorithms tend not to be the right choice in many common cases. Most game developers tend to indicate that using flat arrays tends to be good enough to give themselves the performance they need.
