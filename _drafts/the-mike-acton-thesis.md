In his now famous Data-Oriented Design CppCon talk, Mike Acton made a statement that I didn't appreciate at the time but has since become fundamental to the way I think about programming.

Mike made a lot of good or at least though provoking points in his talk, and if you've never seen it I'd recommend giving it a watch sometime, but the statement he made that I want to discuss today is the "only purpose of any code is to transform data".

This sounds simple enough and, depending on your experience, might even seem obvious. Yet I suspect this is not obvious to most programmers, despite the fact that this is actually how computers work, because the truth of it is obscured and hidden via various and sometimes multiple abstractions.
