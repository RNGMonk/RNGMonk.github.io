title: A Curated List of Awesome Things
category: blog
---

This is a personally curated list of things that have had a profound impact on me, that I still consider to be excellent after many years. 

Time acts as a filter because the longer you live, the more you have to compare with and the harder it is for something to remain relevant, or to provide novelty. There are many things that I once considered relevant that have been removed from this list and perhaps more will be removed in time.

When I consider this list, I generally notice a few common themes which might tell the reader something about myself. 

The most obvious theme is a strong philosophical leaning in much of these works. These are particular evident in Planescape: Torment, Deathnote, the Matrix and Dune.
