I have a confession, I'm a poor writer and have historically been terribly inconsistent with blogging in the past.

Recently I've come to the realisation that I spent far more of my spare time consuming things and producing things and I'd like that to change. For reasons I won't go into here, I've reached a fork in the road of my life and it's got me thinking about what I think I know, who I am and what I want.

I've got a lot of ideas floating around my head that have been accumulating for years and one of my goals for the blog is to explore and consolidate these ideas for myself as well as to serve as a place to record my own thoughts and experiments.

Currently, I have 3 ongoing or upcoming experiments:
1. A Fitness Experiment
2. A Learning Experiment
3. A Making Experiment
