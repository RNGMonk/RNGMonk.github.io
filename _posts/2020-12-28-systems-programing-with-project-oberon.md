A week ago I received an email informing me that my application to the Recurse Center had been accepted. It's been a while since I've felt this excited about something.

If you've never of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) before, it's a New York based self-directed educational retreat for programmers. The basic idea is to work on a project or topic you're interested in with a batch of other curious, self-motivated people who are also doing the same in an environment that focuses on sharing, collaboration and serendipitous encounters.

For my batch I've decided to work on [Project Oberon](http://www.projectoberon.com/) which describes the design of a computer, compiler and operating system from scratch. Oberon is (confusingly) both the name of the programming language and the operating system itself. It was primarily designed by Niklaus Wirth who is also the creator of Pascal and Modula. 

The impressive thing about the whole system is that it weighs in at only about 10,000 lines of code including non-essential functionality and applications such as networking and graphics editing. The authors intended the system to be simple enough for an individual to understand in its entirety yet sophisticated enough to use for real work. That seems like a very difficult balance to strike and I'm curious to understand the trade-offs that make a system like this possible.

In order to increase my chances of a successful batch I need to be careful with how I define and scope this project. My current thinking is to focus on understanding and implementing only the essential parts of the system. If that goes well I could have various 'stretch goals' that I could attempt depending on the time I had remaining.

Fortunately my batch only starts at the end of March after my current contract work is completed, which gives me a bit of time to think about and explore the best way to approach the problem.
