This interface was created a long time ago and never got completed and published.
The eyeball site was getting underway and I could
not work with two sites at the same time so I had to drop this project. <br><br>

•<font size=-2 color=c4aF64>I have a full working copy of the
front page design with all the animations without any working links.

This is the first logo of my ever first homepage that got published. This design
goes way back the good old design days. Before the eyeball site came with the "bouncing
ball" design this was my star attraction. <br><br>

•<font size=-2 color=c4aF64>This blue logo was one of my first images that I ever
published. Most of my early works were deleted or lost and I have only kept a few
works with me.

This is a special slot machine game which was created using javascript 
and some simple graphics. Programming was the least of my interests but
when it involves graphics I was sure to give any idea a try.<br><br>

•<font size=-2 color=c4aF64>The slot machine really works and even keeps
score. <a href=samples/slot/index.htm>Click here</a> if you want to try my
javascript slot machine. </font><font size=-2>
Requires NS3 or MSIE4 to play.

Here is another logo design that was created a long time ago. The logo
was created using <b>truespace 3D</b> which was simple 3D program.
I also had my share and experience with 3D modeling and design but I found out
it wasn't that easy.<br><br>

•<font size=-2 color=c4aF64>The logo is still in use in my
truespace website. I gave up working with the project since the program
required a lot of resources and patience, both of which I don't have.
