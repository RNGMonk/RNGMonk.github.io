THe E-Logo design was one of the designs that was suppose to replace
the eyeball "bouncing ball" logo. This is just one of designs that
I ended up with and most of them were not good enough to be even publsihed.  <br><br>

•<font size=-2 color=c4aF64>I have designed a total of 3 logos and 2
interfaces which were candidates to replace the "bouncing balls" but
none came close enough to beat the design. </a>

This is a test design I created for a mock up company. I always experimented on designs
and interfaces in my spare time and tested new ideas which usually produced
desirable effects,interfaces or designs for future use.<br><br>

•<font size=-2 color=c4aF64>This is one of the many interfaces that I never published.
Most of the designs were incomplete and never used.

Another logo design which never got published due to some technical reasons.
The interface was made to match in the name and I had no problem getting
the effect incorporated in this logo.<br><br>

This was an interface design that I had planned to front this samples
gallery but to limitations of the Dyanmic HTML format that I used the
design will have to wait for a more standard code. <br><br>

•<font size=-2 color=c4aF64>The original design of this interface
was for a white background this version was recreated for black.
