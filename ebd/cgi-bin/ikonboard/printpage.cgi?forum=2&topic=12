        Edit>Transform>.. <br>Perspective, rotation, scale, etc.. <br> <br>Play around with those and you should be able to duplicate the effect.

        My method: <br> <br>Make a new image the size you want each block to be with the appropriate bckgrnd color (or transparent).. <br>i'll use a 10x10 px (small grid) <br>magnify it for ease of use <br>choose the selection tool and select fixed in the tool bar.. <br>make it 10 wide by 1 high <br>place the selection in the top left corner so that it covers the top of the image <br>fill with desired color <br>change the fixed settings to 1 wide by 10 high <br>place the selection in the top left corner so that it covers the left side of the image <br>fill with desired color <br>deselect area <br>edit>define pattern <br> <br>Now you can use this pattern to fill an area with a grid. <br> <br>My method isn't as easy to explain as Q's, but once you try it, it becomes very obvious how to do it.. <br> <br>Hope that helps <br> <br> <br>(Edited by WebWyvern at 10:52 am on Oct. 19, 2001)

        Let me give it a shot. I know PS can do this but the transformation will reduce the sharpness of the lines.  <br> <br> <br> <br>

        <a name="tutorial"></a> <br><img src=http://www.eyeball-design.com/fxzone/dump/create01.jpg> <br> <br>1. You need to create the grid using the Line tool with the "create new work path" selected. Use 2 or 3 px for thickness. I used 1 px and so the lines doesnt appear that good. You can use guides so the position of each line when creating the grid will be equal. <br> <br>2. Once you have the grid, you use the transform option on it. Use the distort option to create the new perspective of the grid. <br> <br>3. Once you got the perspective you want, click on the "load path as selection" button on the path palette. <br> <br>4. Fill the selection. <br> <br>You can get a copy of the PSD for this file and study it. <br> <br> <br><a href=http://www.eyeball-design.com/fxzone/dump/create01.zip>Download the PSD</a> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>(Edited by Raptor at 12:26 am on Nov. 2, 2001)

        I'd try using a couple layers playing around with Hue/Saturation, Blending Modes (color dodge), opacities, and layer masks... but thats just me :)

        You could try using manual airbrushing to create the "flare" around the lighting effect. Use the picker to get the colors of the flare effect for color reference. <br>

        if you have a netrual color for a background then just create layers on top of it that are blured..(white ones or at least light ones) &nbsp;and set the mode to color dodge.. and adj. the opacity.   on PS6 it is a bit different though...  <br> <br>(Edited by xenocide at 12:29 am on Oct. 20, 2001)

        xenocide, how did you get the color dodge effect to be straight? did you just make lines above the layer and set to color dodge? cus that doesn't work for me :( i'm probably doing something wrong.

        Ya theres two things that i think people pay way to much for w/o realizing it <br> <br>domains names <br>and photoshop books. <br> <br>Domain names can be as low as 8 bucks...yet some sorry fools still pay the 70 bucks. Why god why?!?!  <br> <br>Photoshop books are great, but some people don't realize learning FOR FREE online is better than buying certain books TO START OFF. Once you actually get a hang of photoshop you'll be able to read and understand the books w/o having to go through some stupid 'dummies' book that in the end is rather useless.  <br> <br> <br>(Edited by TheDPQ at 8:25 am on Oct. 22, 2001)

        Well, I actually used to go to Namezero, create an account, and get a domain name (ie clanuic.com) <br>Then, I'd link it to somewhere in tripod, which would redirect you to the geocities page. &nbsp;Normally, Namezero pages have a banner at the bottom, but I found that once I'd redirected twice, the banner was gone, I still had clanuic.com and people were able to get to my site. &nbsp;=)
