        They used a Javascript animation script for the main page. &nbsp;Those are floating images with transparent backgrounds I would assume. &nbsp;Nice work though.

        Uh the point of the contest isn't to find someone ELSE work and try and win something. That seems sorta pointless don'tcha think? <br> <br>How do we know they did it? I'm sure Ry has his ways of verifying it.
