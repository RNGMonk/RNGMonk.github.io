        alright guys, give me truth... <br> <br>Am i the only one that's looked at a sunset and thought, "wow, i wonder if i could make that in photoshop" &nbsp;or looked at a commercial thinking "that's an awesome gradient, i wonder if i could duplicate that" ? &nbsp; <br> <br>i'm beginning to think i'm spending way too much time with graphics... maybe this isn't healthy ;) &nbsp;

        I am the same way, &nbsp;I am always thinking, is there a way I can duplicate that? &nbsp;or &nbsp;That would be a good effect to learn just by watching movies and tv. &nbsp; <br>Well I am hoping its normal but I do feel kind of addicted, lol <br>

        I also have the mindset of an addicted photoshopper, but I usually can't recreate what I see :)

        I also spend most of the time trying to replicate things i see on tv or life and most of the time to no availe (sp.)? <br>I think that there is no such thing as too much photoshop and especially since you have oppertunitys to get a really good job in graphic design.

        Yeah, I get that way sometimes too...seeing things in wireframe, or how to create them in layers and gradients......its only bad when you start telling other people

        I think it's more of an necessity to see things and think "that'd look cool on my site" or whatever, I mess about with a 3D prog. and the number of times I've seen a sunset or cloud formation and spent days trying to get something like it... resulting in mass euphoria or complete depression... some kinda thing is happening to me in PS... and I like it... :)

        Yeah, it gets freaky when you see a sign post and go, wow I could make that with a pipe gradient, set to 0 degrees, oh wouldn't it be so cool if..... <br>But I'm sorry dreaming in wireframe is just a little disturbing...

        dreaming in wireframe! &nbsp;that'd be awesome! &nbsp;now i need to learn how to manipulate my dreams so i can do that too =) &nbsp; <br> <br>LOL yes the sign thing! &nbsp;i've done that! &nbsp;"HEY i could replicate that exactly if i used..." &nbsp;and everyone's like *smiles and nods* <br> <br>yeah, i guess the girlfriend thing could work for you, HiepNotik, but that idea backfires over here.... my boyfriend is also into photoshop. &nbsp;so it's not much of a distraction... it's more like "hey check this out" &nbsp;"COOL!" &nbsp;"how'd you do that?" &nbsp;"well.. *begins rant*" &nbsp; <br> <br>*lol* anyway, enough of my craziness. &nbsp;i'm off to bed. &nbsp;night guys.
