        It would be unapropriate to say that? - If &nbsp;the juges were to say nething about what they like the best ppl would do nething to make their like the one the judges like ?

        if someone reply to this, it can hurt many artist out there.. <br> <br>you cannot say who is the best... it is same like love.. you can't say someone is the most beautiful one in the world..

        Thats true lets leave that to the judges, but you can say which is better if you tell us why you like them, or you can tell a person how to improve it would be nice.

        I can tell at least that all of them are winners. It's hard to say which is better than other because of the different skill levels. Maybe some of them worked harder than others and they won't be elected. <br> <br>(Edited by Magochi at 6:47 am on Dec. 2, 2001)
