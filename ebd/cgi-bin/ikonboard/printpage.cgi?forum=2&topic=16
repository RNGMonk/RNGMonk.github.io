        Sup, ok here's my prob, hopefully its a ez one... <br>Ok, well I just got Adobe 6.0 and im trying to make a interface. SO I looked at your tutorials and got some information off them. Ok, now when I go to make it and put all my shapes together to get it what I want it to look like I can't delete anything off them. Like Say I wanted to make a Circle and a Rectangle have like a smooth flow going into each other. Well I saw that you have to get anyother Rec. and put it by the circle and rec. and use the marquee tool to shape it. Well I can get the tool to go over the shape but when i hit delete it says "Content of the Layer is not directly editable"  <br> <br>Can anyone help? <br> <br>

        Yep. You're using the shape tool to make your shapes, right? Well, right click the layer and click "Rasterize layer." That will let you edit it.

        lol it would have taken me longer to figure that out too if I didnt spot the points when working on the "create a new work path" mode for the different shape tools

        omg, it took me sooooo long to figure out WTF I was doing with paths.. I'd drag the mouse one way and it would curve the other!! I was like WTF?! grr.. But then I found the other 6 tools for making paths :) <br> <br>ALSO.. omg... the gradient tool, that worked fine. BUT WHERE WAS THE darn <br> PAINT BUCKET?! It took me an hour to find it! FINALLY I gave up and went to the help file, lol.. but thats my story :) <br> <br>(Edited by Raptor at 5:48 pm on Oct. 22, 2001)

        I couldn't find rasterize in the dictionary, but I'm assuming it is in someway derived from the word raster, which means: <br><font face=arial size=1><blockquote><hr noshade size=1>A scanning pattern of parallel lines that form the display of an image projected on a cathode-ray tube of a television set or display screen.<hr noshade size=1></blockquote></font> <br> <br>Lemme put Rasterize into more of a Photoshop terminology though. Open a new document, and take your text tool and type something. Commit your changes, and click back on the text with your text tool. See how you can still edit the text? Now, right click the layer and rasterize it. Boom, text is no longer editable. In other words, make sure you don't have any spelling errors ;)

        There are two real types of images on computers: <br> <br>1. Raster Graphics: This is any graphic that uses a grid of pixels to make the image (i.e. bmp, jpeg, gif, etc.) &nbsp;The more pixels the better the detail. &nbsp;The downfall: Increasing image size gets the jaggy edges. <br> <br>2. Vector graphics: This is any graphic that uses mathmatics to draw the image such as draw circle with a radius of 90. &nbsp;This is good because no matter the size you get the same quality, just the math changes. &nbsp;Programs like Corel Draw, Illustrator and Flash use this format. &nbsp;Downfall: loss of detail and control. <br> <br>Rasterizing the layer basically means converting to pixels so that you can used the raster tools, such as filters, to that layer. &nbsp; <br> <br>Hope this helped.

        as an added note, text layers are vector graphics natively, that's why you have to go through that whole render layer thing if you want to apply filters and effects to it.
