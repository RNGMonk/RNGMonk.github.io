        Yeah i used to love CS before they released HLH its just ruined it ! <br>Also have you seen some of the art work , its amazing , thats the reason im asking this question , coz if you can use the .mdl files in 3d studio max (which u definately can!) then you must be able to use them in bryce (bryce being able to use 3d studio and maya model files) <br>I been wanting to do it for ages , and have asked on a few forums but with no replies at all ! <br>Just thought there may be someone here that would know ? <br>Here is a pic of my desktop , cs done in 3d studio max ;O) (177 kb) <br><a href="http://spots.flatland.com/vampire/counter-strike066.jpg" target="_blank">http://spots.flatland.com/vampire/counter-strike066.jpg</a> <br>Thanks  <br> <br>[E.S.P] <br> <br> <br>(Edited by esp at 5:42 pm on Dec. 13, 2001)

        Doesn't Milkshape 3D do something like that? <br>Might be wrong though, I've never worked on CS Models.

        Its ok i found out how , but its not gonna work as id thought :( <br>1st off i had to do it in windows 98 coz i installed (milkshape) already a while back on XP (31 day shareware trial) <br>Then all was going cool i converted model all posed and skinned up to .3ds , but when i opened up in bryce there was no texture file , so it was just a flat grey model ! And the model looked crap detail anyway , so until i can get 3d studio im afraid i wont be rendering decent CS pics :( <br>P.S. i found how to do it here > <a href="http://art.counter-strike.net/3dsmax-01-01.shtml" target="_blank">http://art.counter-strike.net/3dsmax-01-01.shtml</a> if anyone is interested in trying it in max ;o) <br> <br>(Edited by esp at 12:40 am on Dec. 14, 2001)

        From the Bryce Software Forum at Rederocity, <br> <br>"PolyTrans and 3D Exploration can convert them. I don't know why you would want to use CS/TFC models as they are very very low poly."  <br> <br>"If you change them into .cob or .x or .dxf from 3d exploration <a href="http://www.xdsoft.com/explorer/" target="_blank">http://www.xdsoft.com/explorer/</a> you can then use Metasequoia to increase the poly count. Get the freeware not the shareware <a href="http://www1.sphere.ne.jp/mizno/main_e.html"" target="_blank">http://www1.sphere.ne.jp/mizno/main_e.html"</a> <br> <br>Dunno if this is any help or not.

        Very smooth looking... look forward to seeing some nice renders, you should become a member of Renderocity.com the shear amount of forums on different software is amazing, tuts and models the lot.
