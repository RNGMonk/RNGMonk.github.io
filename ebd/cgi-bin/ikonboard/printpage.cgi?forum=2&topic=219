[new layer] make the circle again in another color :D fx. purple <br>3. gaussian blur your purple circle till ur satisfied <br>4. take the white circle ontop of the purple layr and toy with the rest <br> <br>- REALLY I <b>Could be wrong </b>

        asdf. gio, you are wrong ;) <br> <br>Max FLD: New document, whatever size you want, and a transparent background. Fill that layer with a dark shade of color - purple, blue, orange, whatever. but it has to be a dark shade.  <br> <br>Make a new layer, with a white circle. Guassian blur the hell out of it. Now click Edit -> Fill with mode behind, and color black. Change the layer blending mode to color dodge.

        asdf again. Gio was on the right track, but you need the black as part of that layer for the color dodge to work right :)

        well i didn't do that technique. my glow is different.  <br><img src="http://theremixx.homestead.com/files/logostuff.jpg"> <br> <br>there are many ways to do a glow effect, just find one that is easier and more versatiile so you can pop in a glow texture at any time. <br> <br>(Edited by ReMiXx at 8:51 am on Dec. 11, 2001)

        Raptor how did you get the black background for the glow. I followed your steps but could not achieve a black background.

        i didn't use black. its a really really really really dark purple.. so dark that it looks black. if you want, start with a normal purple. then go through the steps, then adjust the hue/saturation on the purple layer until its a dark color, but you still have the glow.

        I like Raptors glow better than the one with the plugin.  <br> <br>Hey ReMIXx is there a tutorial on how you got your glow. I think yours would be more useful. To me anyway.
