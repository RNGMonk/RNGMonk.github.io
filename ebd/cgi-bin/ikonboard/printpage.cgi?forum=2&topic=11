        I am trying to manipulate a photo such that it will look as though it's a black and white drawing... anyone has got any ideas?

        From one of the wastedyouth.org tutorials (the site is temporary down): <br> <br>Go to Filter->Stylize->Find Edges. You have obtained the shape of the object you want but it is surrounded by a lot of "noise". To fix that problem you have to go to Image->Adjust->Levels dragging the right pointer until the picture is clean of that noise, but not to much taking care to not deteriorate the shape...  <br> <br>You can also try this tutorial: <br>http://www.bizark.com/learn/painting/

        I think you can find a built in photoshop filter that could do that. Try playing around with the &nbsp;Artistic filters. <br>
