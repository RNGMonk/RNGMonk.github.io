        How many entries are you allowed to enter? I was browsing the entries section and saw that one guy entered quite a few "Philloader" sites. Are we allowed to enter more than one page?

        Currently we have no limit on the number of entries but we are planning on limiting the entries to a certain number.  <br> <br>Remember the entry must be a splash / intro / front page and the one submitting the entry must be the creator or owner of the page. <br> <br>The complete rules for the contest will be released shortly.

        On that (1 page comment), I have seen some entries that launch a pop-up window ontop of a splash page or from the splash page. &nbsp;Does the pop-up count or just the splash underneath?

        Actually we forgot to add an option in our form so you could specify what type of entry are you submitting. If it was a splash, a front or an intro page. We will consider that page linked by the splash pag if ever it would take us to an intro page. Hopefully the new rules we are trying to complie and complete will help clear up matters like this.
