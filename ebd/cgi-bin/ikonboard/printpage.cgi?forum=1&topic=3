        No limit on that but you must remember that people are using different resolutions so you have to make sure it works well on most resolutions. You could lose a few points for functionality if it does not work with the resolution the judges may be using :) <br> <br>Good Luck!

        You can always start working on an interface and then withdraw silently when you see the entries later on.. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>"DON'T think I'll put my project on there....." <br> <br>Bah, like you say: it can be a really useful challange so why not take it (if one has the time)? <br> <br>... <br>
