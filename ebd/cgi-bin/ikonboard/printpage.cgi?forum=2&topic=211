        Hey, <br>Does anyone know how to create a cutaway sphere like the ones you see in an atlas or solar system book where you can see the different layers. (eg core, outer core, crust, etc). <br> <br>Thanks <br>Max <br>Developer

        I'm not a graphics pro, but i'm assuming you need a 3d program like 3d studio max. &nbsp;Someone can correct me if i'm wrong.

        nah. with enough knowledge of the way 3D objects look you can do it in photoshop. sometimes it just gets time consuming is all. How would you do it? You'd have to draw each section at a time. <br> <br>"Huh?" Well, when I went about making a cube, I thought to myself.. "How do I draw this on a piece of paper?" Then, once I had that figured out i just had to think of how i could do that in photoshop.

        Looks like AEON to the rescue, I will post this tutorial tomarrow night (need sleep). &nbsp;It won't be completely 3D but you will get the idea, to make it 3d all you need to do is mess with the gradient tool. &nbsp;I will explain everything tomarrow, just keep visiting the forums tomarrow say 7 or 8 pm EST. &nbsp;It will be a big tutorial but I will explain everything in detail.

        Like this Max?... <br> <br>Bi-Sected Globes <br><img src="http://gurus.onlinedesignschool.com/bi-sected_globe.jpg"> <br> <br>As you can see in the image above, it's just a matter of duplicating your initial globe shape, filling that with a solid colour, and sizing it down - and/or also moving it left, right, up or down, to suit the perspective you want. <br>Then repeating those steps for as many inner layers as you want to have. <br> <br>TIP: create and size all of the layers first, then 'link' them together and move them all at once. <br>And take notice of how the 'inner layers' are positioned when viewing them from an angled perspective - they're not centered to each other. <br> <br>Any questions, just ask. <br> <br>(Edited by theGuest at 7:22 pm on Dec. 12, 2001) <br> <br> <br>(Edited by theGuest at 7:44 pm on Dec. 12, 2001)

        something looks a little off to me, can't quite put my finger on it, perhaps light sources maybe even the perspective, or maybe I didn't get enough sleep last night, hehe.

        I'm not sure I understand the effect you want. This is what I think you're asking about. <br> <br><img src="http://www.theonlineimage.com/adults/cutaway.jpg"> <br> <br>This is done with 3 simple circles on 3 seperate layers. Then use the edit-transform-distort to make them look right. The only trick is with the inner circle. You need to select the inner circle. Now make a new layer and move the selection to the right of the circle on the layer below. Now go to select- transfor selection-scale. Now scale the selection from the left handle till you get a slight curve. Now invert selection and make the layer with the small circle active. Now delete. This should give you the slight curve needed to make the inner circle look like it is protruding from the center of the larger circle. <br> <br>Man I hope that makes sense. It sounds more complicated than it is. If this is the effect you're after and can't follow my instructions just say so and I'll try to make it clearer for you.

        naaa... the perspective is fine. <br> <br>I think what you're seeing is that the bottom right sphere has a reversed light source on it, compared to the other ones. That was a goof-up i admit, wasn't thinking 'bout that really. But i don't think that's actually pertinent to what Max was asking about. (:?)=)

        Good example Pgraphics. <br> <br>Hey?... you should turn on the "Anti-Aliasing" option for your selection tool(s) though bud. Your shapes have a bad case of 'the jaggies'. ;)>

        Ya..I noticed it a little late but since it was an example I didn't fix it.  <br> <br>The real question is my explanation clear?

        Aaa, ok i see. <br> <br> <br>Well, if either of ours aren't clear enough alone, i'm sure they're clear enough when combined. ;)

        Pgraphics: for that inner circle, I think maybe it would be better to load a selection on the inner ellipse (the darker one). Then move that selection over to the portion of the inner circle you want to delete, inverse your selection, and delete. Maybe it would look a little more natural? I dont know if it'd look right or not.
