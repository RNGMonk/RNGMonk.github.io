        Awesome! How is the lighting done especially the circular lightning effect?

        looks cool xenocide.. <br> <br>just the effect around the letters seems to stand out too much to me.. <br> <br>but the rest is very nice.

        Create a new layer. <br>Pick the Linear Gradient Tool. <br>With Black to White, drag from the top to the bottom. &nbsp; <br>Filter->Render->Difference Clouds. <br>Image->Adjust->Invert. &nbsp; <br>Image->Adjust->Levels. <br>Drag the middle slider to the right.  <br> <br>Thats just one way that is real easy..

        on a square image, you make a vert white bar, blur it as much as you want, then run the wind filter on it... &nbsp;After you have it pretty cool that way run polar coordinates filter on it .. rect²polar...  <br> <br>

        yeah.. that one is random due to the difference clouds filter. &nbsp;theres many other ways to do it.. that one is just simple in my opinion

        When you use the gradient-clouds-invert way to get the lightning how exactly do you get the black in the background to go transparent

        set the layer that it is on to screen blending mode on the layers palette. &nbsp;That will let all light colors (white) through, and dark will be transparent.
