        hmmm.... when you slice your images.. the ones for the bottuns. change sumat and export again as another filename. then i ex. DreamWeaver just insert: "roolover image" :D

        Actually its called roll-overs you can do it in JAVA or my way using Flash 5. you can not do thatin photosop. Photoshop is use for graphbic not animation, if you still want to learn how just as DiJaBu in Flash fourm hes very good at flash or you can ask me I can do roll-overs.

        if you really want, you can use imageready to do this. In photoshop you make your buttons, with the mouseover effects in a different layer. then you jump to imageready, and make your slices. then create a new rollover state, and show your layers. I did this whole image using photoshop and imageready: <br><a href="http://www.umich.edu/~jvhollan/colors.html" target="_blank">http://www.umich.edu/~jvhollan/colors.html</a> <br> <br>(Edited by Raptor at 7:54 pm on Dec. 12, 2001)

        it comes with ps6, i'm not so sure about ps5. at the bottom of the toolbar there is a button that allows you to "jump to imageready" if that's not how it works in ps5, i'm sure somebody else here knows. theres a few people here that use ps5 that will be willing to help :)

        You had to choose to install image ready with ps6, when you first installed it otherwise you won't have it. &nbsp;My suggestion is reinstall ps6
