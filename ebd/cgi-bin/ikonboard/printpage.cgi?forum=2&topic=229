        Hey guys, I play a motocross game online called motocross Madness 2, &nbsp;And u can create your own tracks with disp. maps and a custom program, Making textures is a very big part of the track creating process cuz the tracks look bad without good textures, &nbsp;Like, &nbsp;DIRT on track and grass off track, &nbsp;the dirt usually has ruts and stuff in it, &nbsp;Im gonna hold a mini-competition stlye thing here, &nbsp;no prizes, &nbsp;just pride, see who can make the best textures out of this outline, &nbsp; Dont worry im not going to steal your textures because the track i made these outline textures for is already released, and Unless you make the exact same track the textures will look horrible because of the rendered shadows (long story short i wont rip your textures) <br> <br><a href="http://wsphotofews.excite.com/002/uY/Xb/2o/hQ34776.jpg" target="_blank">http://wsphotofews.excite.com/002/uY/Xb/2o/hQ34776.jpg</a> &nbsp; Thats the textures i used, &nbsp;for the most part, &nbsp;U make a whole Dirt texture and a whole grass texture, &nbsp;you put the grass layer above the dirt one then erase over the track path then draw brown lines for the ruts set the layer mode to multiply and change the opacity, then use the burn tool around them, &nbsp;Thats just a basic idea though. &nbsp;Since the track makers make some awesome textures. i wonder what photoshop pro's can whip up
