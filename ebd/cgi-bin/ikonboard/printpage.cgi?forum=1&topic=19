        It has been at least 6 months since I have visited eyeball-design and I have to say that I was shocked to see some new stuff Ryan! I have been doing web design off and on for about 2 years and I would like to finally say thank you for your tutorials. It was you that gave me the jump start that I needed. I do not work as a designer nor do I make any money doing so. I do website designs purely because I love to do it in my free time. You have been a great inspiration and now with all this new stuff I will be hooked again. It took me about a week to complete the design that was submitted and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did making it. <br> <br>Good luck to all and again thanks to Ryan for making it possible!
