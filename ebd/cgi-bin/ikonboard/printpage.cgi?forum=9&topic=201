        well i was making a post in the "off-borad" section and i came up with an idea.. y not make the same thing juzt with a pictyre? i made a logo, and it is the same rules as allways. u only got the .jpg to temper with... that goeas for all og us :D  <br> <br>here it is:  <br><img src="http://www.friserverplads.dk/fxzone/eyeball.jpg">  <br> <br>the idea is th let the logo &nbsp;stand out... witch means is must b in the front :D <br> <br>- AND NO THIS PICTURE IS ONLY BEING USED FOR THIS LITTLE EXPERIMENT :D <br> <br>-thx for participating <br>

        what he wants you to do is to make something out of that logo, like add texture to it or something... thats what im guessing so i can be wrong

        Nice Rappy, I think that we should support the OPEN SOURCE idea. If I have something cool that can be retrace or recreate, I am sure you guys will have the source file too.  <br> <br>"Artist that feels unsecure is not an artist at all" - Hugo

        hm... why not have duels?  <br> <br>i.e. one person vs another, only them 2 can alter the pic, the rest can watch and give commentary (but no help, and you can't put any pics up) <br> <br>lots of sites do this, i like it a lot. but everyone has to be professional about it (i.e. ifyou're a spectator and changed the pic around, don't upload it, you can't help anyone and dont say what you hate, just say what you like)

        heh, that one was an accident upon itself. <br> <br>1. first i started w/ the oval shape.. light grey. new layer, set to darken, and change the grey to a darker grey. <br> <br>2. another new layer, fill the oval with color.. and change this layer blending mode to color. This layer is going to pretty much determine the color of your shape. <br> <br>3. then i worked with a chromelike texture (optional, but for this: render b+w clouds, radial blur 30-50/spin/best, then blur it w/ guass blur if you like, filter -> sketch -> bas relief, then filter -> sketch -> chrome) and adjusted the hue/saturation to a deep blue. blending mode = overlay.  Duplicate this layer too. <br> <br>4. Rewind: you should have 5 layers now. Light grey @ normal, Dark grey @ darken, bluish @ color, and 2 blue-chrome @ overlay. <br> <br>That should give you the color. the rest of the shininess comes from how you do the lighting on it, whether it be airbrushing or a lense flare or whatever. For this one i did some edge darkening and used lense flares :) <br> <br>(Edited by Raptor at 12:01 pm on Dec. 11, 2001)

        <a name="glow"></a> <br>thx for the compliments :) <br>@Nightshade. <br> <br>what colour is fire composed of? orange and yellow (well the shiny part, im not counting blue although you can probably use it) <br> <br>so i figured, how do i give the effect of burning? or the burning glow? <br> <br>take your shape and ctrl click its layer (or use your magic wand.  <br> <br>now feather it a bit so you have that haze effect when you fill it. <br>make a new layer and choose the strongest red in the colour pallete. and fill it in a couple of times ( i think i did it 5 or 6). <br> <br>than make a new layer above that and (with the selection still active) fill it with the strongest yellow. <br> <br>now i didn't want the glow to just end so i made a new layer on top, took some white and filled the feathered selection just a bit (1 or 2, maybe 3 but i dont remember) <br> <br>now take your original shape and copy the layer. move it to the top of all the layers. <br> <br>at first i played around with the layer modes and i found that screen was the best. i used screen for all the 'glow' effects and then played around with the top layer and i think i used darken, or color burn (cus it was too bright my eyes hurt :) <br> <br>the rest is just typography and trendstuff. <br> <br>(i.e. font 3 just type jibberish so it looks cool) <br>the arrow and file were from wingdings or something. <br>the hexagons on the left is a font (sixgun) and the rest was just stuff i played around with. <br> <br>i made a cloud and blurred it with a darker side facing up (this was the ground plain) and then i flipped it and put it together, then i used the single line marquee (horizontal) stroked for.. ujmm. .. i think3 and then blurred it.. <br>a better way is to create a white to transparent gradient (linear) and drag from the middle , upwards on the sky plain, and from the middle downwards on the ground plain. <br> <br> <br>well hope that helps you all out. thx for the nice coments. <br> <br> <br>(Edited by Raptor at 10:40 pm on Dec. 12, 2001) <br> <br> <br>(Edited by ReMiXx at 1:36 pm on Dec. 13, 2001)
