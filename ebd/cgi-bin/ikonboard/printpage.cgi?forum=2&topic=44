        We have decided to go ahead with the live tutorials on IRC after we have found a channel to play host for the session.  The tentative schedule is the second weekend of november. We are still not sure on the best day (friday, saturday or sunday) and the best time for the session to be held.  <br> <br>We want your input on the day and time so we can finalize the schedule with the channel operators and we can start advertising the schedule. Please specify the time in GMT so I don't have to make a time conversion :P <br> <br>Thanks to all who will respond to this inquiry

        Any day is good for me. If it's on a Friday though (and I want to make it) it would have to be after 7 pm GMT. For Saturday and Sunday however, anytime works.

        montilla : we will inform you of the server and channel once we have full confirmation of the schedule with the channel operators. Frankly I need to confirm a sched by next week because I have to get some operators to help me when we do the session. <br>

        Ry will you make an online Chat script that is directly linked to the IRC.. this "lasalle" firewall sucks big time.. i can't go to the IRC or even ICQ..

        We might just do that so you guys don't have to get the IRC program just to logon when we do the live tutorials.  <br> <br>

        Good idea. Not everyone has IRC, like myself. Having some script that runs on a webpage would be a great idea.

        I will probably release a copy of the tutorial on my site once we are done with tutorials for that session. The big advantage you'll get when you participate is you can ask questions directly and get answers in real time.

I just came across this by accident, perhaps a notice that this is going on - on the first part of the forum area would be good, and even on your front page.... I'd say 90% of viewers here have not seen this post, I almost missed it. <br> <br>Cheryl-Anne

        Here are a few questions before I get ahead of myself:  <br> <br>a. If this will materialized, how long will the session be? Any off the bat ideas? I was wondering about breaking the session up into two parts.  <br> <br>I.e. part 1, outline the interface. We will focus all on that on day one. Examples of students and instructors will be on display. Then part 2 next day, where textures and details can be add. Then all up for viewing. <br> <br>b. What kind of tools will we need to bring along (figurative speaking)? I only equipped with Photoshop 6. Was thinking about putting in Freehand 10 and Flash 5. <br> <br>The dates shoudl be on the weekend or something. Since I am not busy at all on those two dates, any time frame will be fine too.

        The schedule will be announced shortly. We will also release a screen shot of the interface or effect that we will be featuring in the session. <br> <br>eyefantry:  <br> <br>a. It could be 1-1 1/2 hours. I will make room for people to ask questions on specific steps. I will also stay for some time after the session is over to answer more questions. <br> <br>b. You'll only need photoshop. Any version will do but I will be using six for my tutorial.
