        Today i was surfing the net for some cool photoshop site's. I then came across some link to PixelCore and there links, it was about  1000+ i think, so i tought when i get home i'll check it out. But when i got home i tried <a href="http://www.pixelcore.com" target="_blank">http://www.pixelcore.com</a> and couldnt find the site i tried everything. Even a searh on yahoo, they found the pixelcore site but IE couldnt find it. Whatever i tried it doesnt work??? Maybe someone here could help me out, or you know the actual site url? <br>thanks anyway <br> <br>(Edited by DG Designs at 2:04 am on Dec. 14, 2001)
