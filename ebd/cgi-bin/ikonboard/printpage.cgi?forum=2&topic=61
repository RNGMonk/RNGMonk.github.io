        well where did you go wrong? do you know how to airbrush? etc etc? <br> <br>first create a polygon with the polygonal lasso tool (basically just click to make a shap and then click on the spot where u first click to load the selection. <br> <br> <br> <br>than use airbrush and use white and blue (as in the page) and the rest is pretty much self explanatory.

        I love that tut. I (more or less) used the same idea to create this image <br><img src="http://www.thedpq.com/kittens/ugly03.jpg"> <br> <br> <br>Ok you have to tell us specifically what sort of problem you are having. Where doyou go wrong?

        I agree, a little more info on where you are having problems. &nbsp;I went ahead and tried it out for myself and didn't get the same results, similar but not the same, is this what you are experiencing? <br>also do you have experience with photoshop cause that is an "expert" tutorial(or at least that what the guy says), maybe that is why you are having trouble... <br>please tell us...
