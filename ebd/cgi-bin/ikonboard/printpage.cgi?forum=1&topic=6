        ziggen, <br> <br>1). You're experimenting, alot. That's good. In fact, that's great. Good work. <br> <br>2). You're telling everyone it's better than someone else's. That's bad. In fact, that sucks. <br> <br>Sorry for the flames guys, that's my humble opinion

        I'm blind, the color pink is burnt into the back of my retina's ahhhhhhh..... jk. &nbsp;I like some of the older incarnations of ziggen better though. &nbsp;good stuff.
