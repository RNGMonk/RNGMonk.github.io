        ok... so i been working on this for a day or two now... what do you think of the main interface... the links on left side have mouseovers for the box on left... <br> <br>the top left link is active... what do you think of the splash section? the links on right are not active but have preview mouseovers... look good or no?? <br> <br>thats about it thanx, unless you have any suggestions or anything... i am thinking about putting the site in a chromeless window as suggested by webby... good idea or no?? <br> <br>http://www25.brinkster.com/blinx/iface.html

        Nice pattern! Although I wouldnt agree with you with the grey color.

        like it, except that you ask people to download the font before coming onto your site, i'm not particularly sure that people will want to do that. (probably wrong) ... <br> <br>*crawls into corner* <b>be gentle...</b>

        Looks great! Work a bit on the mouseovers though, I think it could be done a little better (more cooler)...
