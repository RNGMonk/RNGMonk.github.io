        Ok. <br>Eyeball-design has some of the best, easiest tutorials on the web. I liked all the old tutorials but the new ones rock. <br>I am not a Graphic Artist but with the help of the Depot (Interface Patterns) and the Tutorials I was able to come up with this... <br><A HREF= "http://www.javascript-fx.com/development/ifctest/ifctest.html" target="_blanlk">http://www.javascript-fx.com/development/ifctest/ifctest.html</A> <br> <br>I was looking of some way of introducing myself as I am a programmer not a G.A. so I hope you like the IFC. <br> <br> <br>(Edited by JSFX at 11:29 pm on Nov. 6, 2001) <br> <br> <br>(Edited by JSFX at 11:30 pm on Nov. 6, 2001)
