        I know the rule that 1 and only 1 page could be submitted. However, my situation is that I need visitors to access a simple index page first and then to open my entry page in a window without menu and title bar. If opened directly, the entry page may not get shown up right. <br> <br>So please tell me whether my index page could be accepted, or I must use my entry page directly? <br> <br>Thanks in advance!

        It should be no problem. We automatically consider the second page loaded by the splash page as the entry and not the splash page. This is for those pages that need to appear on certain windows with certain features turned off like the buttons, url bar, etc.
