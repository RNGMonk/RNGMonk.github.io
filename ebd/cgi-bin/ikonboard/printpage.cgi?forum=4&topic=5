        <a href="http://xen-fx.com/beta">http://xen-fx.com/beta<a/> <br>ok this is a way basic beta of my new site design. ( and yes, it was inspired by eyeball-design's orbiting orbs )  i have been working on it for a while and wanted some feedback on it.  I like the basic interface but it still needs more in the background or something.. . hmm any ideas? <br> <br>I have the rest of the images for each orb animation done but i need to optimize them. ( so there will be more then just the dune one )  <br> <br> <br>(Edited by xenocide at 3:51 pm on Oct. 25, 2001)

        no i was using jpeg's because when i did it with gifs origanatly it didn't look as good as i wanted it. &nbsp;It lost a lot of quality, so instead i used 1 jpeg for each frame and used javascript to animate it all.

        ahhh.. i see, so the animation is done using javascript to run the jpegs frame by frames.. hmm.. din really look at the code. it's quite smooth..

        Just gotta fix those orbs. Maybe make the spikes a bit more metalic? <br> <br>

        I noticed that too. The orientation seems to be wrong. The highlight that appears on it is on the wrong side but I could be wrong. *takes another peek*

        I would suggest shrinking the interface to be more conducive to people with lower reslolutions. &nbsp;I'm at 1024x768 and it's off the screen, plus it will load quicker. &nbsp;I have a LAN connection and first time out loads noticably slower than it probably should. &nbsp;I would also suggest it as a pop-up window from your main site (when you click on the high-band width link). &nbsp;Good start. &nbsp;Can't wait to see it when it's done.

        yeah the javascript for those were each done seperately.. &nbsp;I made the orbit from scratch myself but the rolover i don't remember where i origonally got it. &nbsp;i hevaly modified it to fit my need. &nbsp;basically it is just animating .jpg in a sequence ( howerver fast you want.. ) .. &nbsp; i'll post the stripped down ver tonight.. &nbsp;i allready had someone else ask me for it <G> ..  <br> <br>Yeah i need to re-do the blades.. i didn't render the lighting different on each. ( if i remember i think i was just sticking them there to see if they looked cool .. &nbsp;then forgot to render the other two blades... &nbsp; =p )  <br>

        You can do a sequence of animation using the javascript with the setTimeout command. The algo is basically <br> <br>function MyAnimationSequence() { <br> <br>setTimeout('do this after',100) ; <br>setTimeout('do this after',300) ; <br>setTimeout('do this after',400) ; <br> <br>} <br> <br>setTimeout &nbsp;tells a single command to be delayed for a period of time set by a given value. The time is in milliseconds.

         ok. i'll try to get it up this weekend if i'm not to busy.. &nbsp;I was just thinking it would be pretty cool to offer javascript tutorials / templates also for download on my website.. &nbsp;maybe some perl(CGI) php DHTML kind of stuff too. <G> &nbsp; we'll see..

        Hi, <br>I first saw your interface in the competition zone. I thought it looked real good. I was especially aware of the 3D ring that looks really smooth! I have a ring on the interface I am developing (from one of the patterns in the Depot) but mine seems very jagged compared to yours (In fact most of the stuff I do seems to have jaggies). <br>I was very interested in your scripting, it looks similar to something I have seen on <br><A HREF="http://www.ozones.com/toypages/">http://www.ozones.com/toypages/</A> <br> <br>I have had animated rollovers on my site for over 2 years using a script I developed. You might be interested in it. It has undergone various refinements, and the latest version is here. <br><A HREF="http://www.javascript-fx.com/ani_rollovers/index.html">Animated Rollovers</A> The images are not much, they are just for demonstrating the various combinations. <br>If you are interested I would be glad to help. Especially if you can help me get rid of the jaggies from my IFC. <br> <br>
