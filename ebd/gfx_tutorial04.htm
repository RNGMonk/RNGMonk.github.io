	<font color=c4aF64 size=+1><b>Seamless Tiles</b></font><br><hr noshade>
	First load your design on a seperate layer<b>(layer 1).</b> 
	You can see a small amount of space on the <b>left and right side and the upper and lower of the design</b>. What
	we will try to accomplish is to <b>fill those empty spaces</b> with the design. <br><br>

	Make a selection on the half of the design using the <b>marquee tool.</b>

	<tr><td><img src=images/tutorial/gfx/gfx04b.jpg border=0 width=139 height=139><br></td>
	
	<td><font face=arial size=-2>

	With the selection still loaded, <b>press one up arrow key  and one down arrow key</b>.
	The selection will only now select half the contents of the current layer. 
	
	On the <b>layers palette</b></a> you will see
	a layer thumbnail called <b>floating selection,</b> Hold click on this thumbnail and
	drag to the <b>new layer button</b>. <br><br>

	Move the contents of the layers to the edge of each side.<br><br>

	What we've just accomplished is we actually moved the blank spaces around the original design
	and made it the center of the design and the left side of the design is now adjacent to the right side.


	<tr><td><img src=images/tutorial/gfx/gfx04c.jpg border=0 width=139 height=139><br></td>
	
	<td><font face=arial size=-1>

	I added two more letters to fill up the space at the center. This now makes the design
	<b>seamless horizontally</b>. 
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td><img src=images/tutorial/gfx/gfx04d.jpg border=0 width=139 height=139><br></td>
	
	<td><font face=arial size=-1>

	Next we isolate the upper and lower blank space and place it at the center. The process
	is the same as above but you have to now select the upper part of the design and switch their places
	like what we did to make the design horizontally seamless.

	</td></tr>


	<tr><td><img src=images/tutorial/gfx/gfx04e.jpg border=0 width=139 height=139><br></td>
	
	<td><font face=arial size=-1>

	To complete the design, fill in the gap and make sure you cover most of the areas. <br><br>

	</td></tr>
